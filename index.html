            <p>Web Course is moving with current events and technology. Today's workforce is moving online. Forty-six percent of organizations recently surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) said they use virtual teams. 
            <br> <br>
            With that, the number of professionals who regularly work from home has increased 159 percent over the last decade, with more than 4.7 million employees working remotely at least half the time. <br> <br>
			It is clear, then, that learning online helps prepare professionals for this shift toward online work. Below, explore what online courses entail, explore seven key benefits, and get the advice you need to determine if online courses are right for you.

          <h2> 1. Added Flexibility and Self-Paced Learning </h2>
          <p>Not many people have the ability to take time off from work to commit to a full-time graduate program, and others often travel for work. For those who still need to juggle working and going back to school, the flexibility of an online program provides individuals with the opportunity to learn while still working and growing professionally. <br><br>
		By earning your master's degree online, you can learn on your own schedule. Rather than leave the office early or skip family dinner to commute to campus, you're logging on when it's convenient for you at a time that doesn't interfere with other commitments. That flexibility allows you to more easily balance work, life, and graduate school. <br><br>
		Additionally, students don't always feel comfortable asking professors to repeat a point they made in their last lecture or dive into deeper detail on a specific topic. When learning online, you can revisit past material or stop the lecture to perform additional research or organize your notes. You can work through the lesson plan at your own pace to ensure you're really mastering the material before moving on to the next section. This added flexibility allows online learners to move through the course work at their own speed and get the most out of the degree program.
		</p>
      </td>  

      <td>
         <h2> 2. Better Time Management </h2>    
         <p>Juggling work, family, and school isn't an easy thing to do. Employers recognize this and admire the time management skills it takes to balance all three. Because there are no set classroom times within an online degree program, and students have the flexibility to create their own schedules, it's up to the student to proactively reach out to faculty, complete assignments on time, and plan ahead. 
			<br> <br>

		One of the things we know employers expect is that we manage our time effectively. It's never enough to be at your desk on time in the morning and stay through the end of the day; most of us are expected to get more projects done in less time. 
			<br> <br>
		Online classes keep you on a regular schedule of making and meeting deadlines, allowing you to practice managing your time and staying productive week to week. Employers often appreciate the time management skills needed to complete an online degree program and view these skills as a valuable asset in potential employees. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
          <h2> 3. Demonstrated Self-Motivation </h2>
          <p>By successfully earning your master's degree online, you're demonstrating that you can practice time management and are self-motivated, which are among the top 10 employability skills employers want to see in new hires. By succeeding in earning an online degree, you prove that you can tackle multiple tasks, set priorities, and adapt to changing work conditions. <br> <br>

		  Instructors expect students to be independent, to learn on their own, and to engage with the material that they are teaching. It’s the same thing in the workforce; employers want you to be self-motivated, go after things that interest you, and seek new opportunities and ways of doing things. The more you put your heart into it whether it's learning online or working for your employer—the more you'll succeed. </p>
      </td>  

      <td>
         <h2> 4. Improved Virtual Communication and Collaboration </h2>    
         <p>Learning to work with others in a virtual environment can make you a more effective leader. You'll develop critical leadership skills by utilizing specialized knowledge, creating efficient processes, and making decisions about best communication practices, such as what should be discussed in-person or electronically. <br> <br>

		In an online program, you'll also participate in discussion boards with your classmates, communicate with professors via email, and collaborate through various software programs. As the program progresses, you'll get better at pitching your ideas and making strong, succinct, professional arguments through text. <br> <br>

		Participating in discussion boards is a lot like participating in a virtual team. Communicating your ideas clearly, getting responses, and projecting a professional image are necessary skills in a virtual workplace. <br> <br>

		Instructors, just like managers, expect you to write respectful, thoughtful, and polite communications, respond to different perspectives, and build a rapport with your peers. Luckily, in an online program, you'll refine this skill quickly— post after post, week after week, course after course. </p>

    <tr>
      <td>
          <h2> 5. A Broader, Global Perspective </h2>
          <p>Students in online programs come from across the Malaysia and all over the world. Because of the ability to log on from any location, class discussions feature a broader range of perspectives, helping you enhance your own cross-cultural understanding. Students then not only have the opportunity to network with people from around the globe, but can also broaden their perspective and become more culturally aware. <br> <br>

		Businesses are looking for employees who can innovate, and innovation often comes from outside your immediate world. If you're interested in entrepreneurship, for example, hearing how other countries adopt certain technologies or approach specific industries can inspire new ideas or improve an existing concept you've been developing. 
		Being exposed to new ideas from professionals in other countries may spark creativity of your own creativity that can turn out to be valuable for your organization.
		</p>
      </td>  

      <td>
         <h2> 6. Refined Critical-thinking Skills </h2>    
         <p>Online learning facilitates the ability to think critically about what you do every day. The goal in the classroom is to challenge you to think differently, and employers want you to do that, too–to think critically in your role at work. Mastering this skill is what will set you apart as a student, and as an employee.
         	<br> <br>
		Critical thinking plays a role in any type of education; however, online learning forces you to develop your critical thinking skills in ways that you might not have practiced in an in-person classroom setting. This sort of self-paced and self-motivated learning demonstrates to future employers that you have the ability to think critically and overcome any obstacles that might stand in your way. </p>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
    	<td>
    		<h2>7. New Technical Skills </h2>    
         <p> Your online degree also equates to strong technical skills, a definite plus for any job seeker.  As part of your coursework, you will likely need to utilize digital learning materials, get familiar with new tools and software, and troubleshoot common issues. After a program’s worth of technical hurdles, big and small, an employer could trust that you are versed in common collaboration tools, content management systems, and basic troubleshooting. <br> <br>

		With more companies using virtual teams, it's important to learn how to collaborate remotely. Your classmates will likely live in different time zones, which you need to learn how to adapt to and schedule around. <br> <br>

		Embracing technology is also crucial. When you're working on a group project, sharing files or status updates can become difficult via email, so you might need to utilize project management and communication tools such as: Skype, Dropbox, Slack etc.</p>
